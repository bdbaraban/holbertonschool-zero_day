* `0-opening`: The command to open a file from within Emacs.
* `1-saving`: The command to save a file.
* `2-cutting`: The command to cut an entire line.
* `3-pasting`: The command to paste.
* `4-searching`: The command to search forward.
* `5-undoing`: The command to undo.
* `6-quitting`: The command to quit Emacs.
* `100-tetris`: The command to play Tetris inside Emacs.
* `101-doctor`: The command to talk to your doctor.
