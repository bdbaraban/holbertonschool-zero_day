# vi
In this project, I learned about vi and basic vi commands.

## Tasks
* **Inserting**
  * `0-inserting`: The vi command to insert text before the cursor.

* **Cutting**
  * `1-cutting`: The vi command to cut the current line (yank, cut).

* **Pasting**
  * `2-pasting`: The vi command to paste the lines in the buffer into the text after the current line.

* **Undoing**
  * `3-undoing`: The vi command to undo what you just did.

* **Exiting**
  * `4-exiting`: The command to quit vi even though the latest changes have not been saved for the vi call.

* **Beginning of the line**
  * `5-beginning_line`: The vi command to move the cursor to the start of the current line.

* **End of the line**
  * `6-end_line`: The vi command to move the cursor to the end of the line.

* **Line 32**
  * `100-move_to_line`: The vi command to move the cursor to line 32.

* **Delete current and previous line**
  * `101-delete_line`: The vi command to delete the current and previous line at the same time.
