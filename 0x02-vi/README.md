In this project, I learned about vi and basic vi commands.

* `0-inserting`: The command to insert text before the cursor.
* `1-cutting`: The command to cut the current line (yank, cut).
* `2-pasting`: The command to paste the lines in the buffer into the text after the current line.
* `3-undoing`: The command to undo what you just did.
* `4-exiting`: The command to quit vi even though the latest changes have not been saved for the vi call.
* `5-beginning_line`: The command ot move the cursor to the start of the current line.
* `6-end_line`: The command to move the cursor to the end of the line.
* `100-move_to_line`: The command to move the cursor to line 32.
* `101-delete_line`: The command to delete the current and previous line at the same time.
